      <h2>How To Make The Best Original Italian Pizza</h2>
      <p>
        It tastes best when you make it yourself. With just a few ingredients
        you get a delicious pizza dough, which you can then use as you like. The
        preparation is quick and easy.

      <h2>Ingrediends</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
        <li>
          2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a
          wood-fired pizza oven)
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Proof the yeast</h3>
          Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.
          Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes
          until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't
          dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom,
          indicating that the yeast is still active and alive. (Note that if you
          are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is
          required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Make and knead the pizza dough:</h3>
          Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle
          attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing
          paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to
          medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes. If you don't
          have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by
          hand. The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If
          it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Let the dough rise:</h3>
          Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl.
          Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets
          coated with the oil. At this point you can choose how long you want
          the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the
          fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick
          fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to
          rise sufficiently to work with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For
          a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2
          hours. For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room
          temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For
          a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no
          more than 48 hours). The longer the rise (to a point) the better the
          flavor the crust will have.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet):</h3>
          Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat
          the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you
          don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking
          sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Divide the dough into two balls:</h3>
          Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour
          and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in
          half. Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover
          with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Prep the toppings:</h3>
          Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to
          load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not
          crisp that way. About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese
          would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced
          will cover a pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:</h3>
          Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and
          flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface. Starting
          at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the
          dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not
          stretch further. Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to
          stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.
          Treat the dough gently! You can also hold up the edges of the dough
          with your fingers, letting the dough hang and stretch, while working
          around the edges of the dough. If a hole appears in your dough, place
          the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to
          seal the hole. Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it
          is thicker. Pinch the edges if you want to form a lip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Brush the dough top with olive oil:</h3>
          Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of
          the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with olive
          oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest
          another 10 to 15 minutes. Repeat with the second ball of dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Sprinkle the pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened dough on top:
          </h3>
          Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal.
          (The corn meal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza
          from the pizza peel into the oven.) Transfer one prepared flattened
          dough to the pizza peel. If the dough has lost its shape in the
          transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</h3>
          Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your
          desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza
          with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Sprinkle the cornmeal on pizza stone, slide pizza onto pizza stone
            in oven:
          </h3>
          Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your
          hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough
          will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and
          add a bit more cornmeal. Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the
          baking stone in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bake:</h3>
          Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is
          browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want,
          toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more
          cheese.
